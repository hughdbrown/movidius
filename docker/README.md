# Description
This is a docker project for running the Movidius Neural Compute Stick in a linux virtual
environment. Suitable for Mac OSX.

2017-10-21: Currently does not work. I believe the problem is that docker is
commonly run as root and the NCS installation scripts have issues with
installations by root.

This is a work in progress.
